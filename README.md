# PERSYST
Personal Sync System Technology

PERSYST is a peer-to-peer based system for syncing a users files across a network of systems running PERSYST.
It is primarily for syncing files across the local network and will provide an implementation of Hive2Hive.

If you need a Git program, I would recommend [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/).
